# Shopping Cart Kata

A coding kata that focuses on domain modelling and TDD.

## Domain Model

You're implementing a web shop. Through conversation with the client and domain experts, you discovered the following facts:

- A product (represented by its ID) can be added to the shopping cart.
- 

## Constraints

- Use TDD to drive the design.
- Focus on the domain model for this exercise. Make reasonable assumptions about persistence and presentation to allow framework-independent modelling of the domain.
